If this is your first pull request, it may be helpful to read up on the 
[GitHub Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/) first.

My modded BombSquad game's server files has been designed as a base for BombSquad players who are interested in hosting their own BombSquad dedicated server. Please keep this in mind when requesting features and/or submitting pull requests. If it's not something that most people will use, I probably won't consider it. When in doubt ask.

1. Clone the repo.
2. Create a branch off of `master` and give it a meaningful name (e.g. 
   `my-awesome-new-feature`) and describe the feature or fix.
