# BombSquad Server
Repository for my made latest BombSquad server's files.

## Info
This repository contains the my modded files to create a BombSquad game's servers for different OSs; to view the files for the different OSs, switch to the branch which is named as the OS on which you want to create your BombSquad game's server.

The files are updated regularly after every new release of the original BombSquad dedicated server files by Mr. Eric Froemling.

## Installation
To use my modded BombSquad server scripts, just download the latest release of this repository according to the OS system on which you will create the server, and then follow the instructions in the README of the distribution which you cloned/downloaded.

### Youtube video for the installation is coming soon

## Important things to keep in mind:
- If you want a custom playlist then make and export the playlist only from the latest BombSquad game version
- Do not add any other map in the playlist which is not present in the server files.
- Also, please try not to include all same games in a playlist at least use two different games in a playlist.
